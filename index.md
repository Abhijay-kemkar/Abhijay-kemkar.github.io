## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="dp.jpg">

Hi! I am Abhijay. I am a pre-final year student at Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), Pilani, majoring in Mechanical Engineering. I am broadly interested in Robotics, particularly in Aeriel Robotics, UAVs, Motion Planning and Machine Learning.

I am currently working under [Prof. Solomon Raju](https://www.ceeri.res.in/profiles/kota-solomon-raju/) at the [CRIS Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute](https://www.ceeri.res.in) in Pilani, as a research Asistant. I worked on [Sructural Health Monitoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_health_monitoring) using Machine Learning, mostly experimenting with 2nd order ODE to better capture the model curvature and matrix curvature analysis. Details can be found in my résumé/CV or under the projects section. 

I most recently worked as an Inderpendant researcher under [Hanna Hans](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hanna-hans-360a8718a/) at [Thynklogy](https://thynklogy.com). I focused on designing and developing an Autonomous UAV navigation and human detection algorithm. I also worked on existing Human Detection algorithms such as HOG and Haar Cascades, and UAV navigation algorithms such as [FIESTA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02144), [Voxblox](https://voxblox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Artificial Potential Fields](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236268166_An_Efficient_Improved_Artificial_Potential_Field_Based_Regression_Search_Method_for_Robot_Path_Planning). For the implementation, I made a simple CNN architecture to detect humans trained on the MIT Pedestrian Dataset.

I also interned at [Plastic Water Labs, Bangalore](http://www.plasticwaterlabs.com), a research lab, where I worked on a Defect Detection algorithms using Deep Learnging and Convolutional Neural Networks.

I am a huge fan of travelling, already visitefd 6 countries and counting! I am also a huge fan of TV series, having watched motly all of the popular sitcoms, sci fi and horror shows!! I am also a national level chess player and was the youngest one to win the uner 7 age categories in the states!

## Research Interest

My research interests primarily lie in the field of Robotics and machine learning, as well as their applications. I am fascinated by **Bipeds** and pretty much everything related to it, though I am slightly inclined towards researching on the human walking mechanismns as a tool for **Humanoid Robots** and that sparks my interest in **bipedal locomotion**. I have also developed an interest in **UAVs**, researching at the intersection of Robotics and computer vision.
