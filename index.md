## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="dp.jpg">

Hi! I am a junior year student of B.E. Computer Science at Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani.
I like to explore different fields and keep learning!! Currently i'm learning to make machines learn.

I also like to travel a lot and I've done many short treks in the Himalayas.

I seldom wake up early and like to think of myself as being a night-owl. Blame my alarm. 
The only time I wake up early is when I want to play Badminton or Tennis! I have also
taken part in Indian Classical Instrumental 
Orchestra as a Hawaiin Guitarist. 

I also like to take part in various social 
service activities. I'm currently a member of NSS-BITS Pilani chapter, where I 
teach Computers to people. I have also taught in a school run by Sri Aurobindo 
Education Society for disadvantaged childern. I have also served in the Sri 
Aurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry.

Some of my other interests are Competitive Coding (spoj, codeforces, codechef)
and touch-typing, having clocked 81wpm at keyhero.

## Research Interest

My research interests are mainly in the field of Machine Learning with a focus on ANN. I love understanding how such models work and mimic humans in cognitive tasks. I love to take a multidisciplinary approach to every problem I face.

I have worked on Wearables and IOT and I believe in the theory to make **my** world
personalized to **me**! That's probably the reason I like softwares and platforms 
which I can customize a lot! I believe that IOT along with machines that mimic humans
will be a starting step to make my world tuned to my needs and wishes.

No, I'm not selfish. I just believe that everyone should live in a world personalized
to them. Wouldn't **that** be great!?
