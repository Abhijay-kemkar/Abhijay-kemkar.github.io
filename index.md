## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="dp.jpg">

Hi! I am Abhijay. I am a pre-final year student at Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), Pilani, majoring in Mechanical Engineering. I am broadly interested in Robotics, particularly in Aeriel Robotics, Pattern Recognition, Computer Vision, Motion Planning and Machine Learning.

I am currently wokring as a research intern in Computer Vision under [Prof. Hanspeter Pfister](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/person/hanspeter-pfister) with the [Visual Computing Group, Harvard ](https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu). Working on Video Instance Segmentation and Annotation for multi-scene, long-term shots using deep learning to publish a paper in CVPR'21 whuich presents a new video instance segmentation benchmark dataset, with 200 full-length top popular Youtube videos from 10 major video genres and 500K high-quality instance masks. Then, it also proposes the novel Shot-aware Multi-bank Memory (SMM) module to better integrate features from previous frames to support queries for long-term and cross-shot object segmentation.

I am also currently working under [Prof. Solomon Raju](https://www.ceeri.res.in/profiles/kota-solomon-raju/) at the [CRIS Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute](https://www.ceeri.res.in) in Pilani, as a research Asistant. I worked on [Sructural Health Monitoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_health_monitoring) using Machine Learning, mostly experimenting with 2nd order ODE to better capture the model curvature and matrix curvature analysis. Details can be found in my résumé/CV or under the projects section. 

I most recently worked as an Inderpendant researcher under [Hanna Hans](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hanna-hans-360a8718a/) at [Thynklogy](https://thynklogy.com). I focused on designing and developing an Autonomous UAV navigation and human detection algorithm, along with working on existing Human Detection algorithms such as HOG and Haar Cascades, and UAV navigation algorithms such as [FIESTA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02144), [Voxblox](https://voxblox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Artificial Potential Fields](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236268166_An_Efficient_Improved_Artificial_Potential_Field_Based_Regression_Search_Method_for_Robot_Path_Planning). For the implementation, I made a simple CNN architecture to detect humans trained on the MIT Pedestrian Dataset.

I also interned at [Plastic Water Labs, Bangalore](http://www.plasticwaterlabs.com), a research lab, where I worked on a Defect Detection algorithms using Deep Learnging and Convolutional Neural Networks.

I am a huge fan of travelling, already visitefd 6 countries and counting! I am also a huge fan of TV series, having watched motly all of the popular sitcoms, sci fi and horror shows!! I am also a national level chess player and was the youngest one to win the uner 7 age categories in the states!

## Research Interest

My research interests primarily lie in the field of Robotics, Computer Vision and Machine Learning, as well as their applications. I am fascinated by **Bipeds** and pretty much everything related to it, though I am slightly inclined towards researching on the human walking and vision mechanismns as a tool for **Humanoid Robots** and that sparks my interest in **Computer Vision** and **Bipedal Locomotion**. I have also developed an interest in **UAVs**, researching at the intersection of Robotics and computer vision.
