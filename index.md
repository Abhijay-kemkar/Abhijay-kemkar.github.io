## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="dp.jpg">

Hi! I am Megh. I am a final year student at Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), Pilani, majoring in Computer Science. I am broadly interested in Natural Language Processing, particularly in dialogue systems, question answering systems and conversational AI.

I am currently a research intern under [Prof. Chng Eng-Siong](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/aseschng/) at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx) as part of my bachelor thesis. I am working on emotion recognition from speech and text in a multi-part dialogue environment. This is also where I had my first encounter with dialogue system as well as GCNs.

I previously worked under [Prof. Chris Biemann](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/people/chris-biemann.html) at the [Language Technology Lab](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/home.html) in [Universität Hamburg](https://www.uni-hamburg.de/en.html). I worked on query-autocompletion for unseen prefixes, mostly experimenting with using contextualized embeddings to better capture the sense. Details can be found in my résumé/CV or under the experience section. 

In my sophomore year, I was lucky to get selected for [Google Summer of Code, 2018](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2018/projects/6278298501906432/) as a part of the amazing [BioJS](biojs.net) community. I was mentored by [Rowland Mosbergen](https://twitter.com/rowlandm?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), [Yo Yehudi](http://yo-yehudi.com/) and [Dennis Schwartz](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/dennis-schwartz-093315b3). 

I also interned at [Indian Institute of Remote Sensing](https://www.iirs.gov.in/), a research centre of [Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO)](https://www.isro.gov.in/), where I worked on a flight planning software for a UAV.

I am a huge fan of travelling, mostly travelling cheap and light. I am on a **mission** of travelling to 21 countries before I turn 21 (12 Nov 2019), with 3 more to go! I am also a huge fan of electronic music, having attended [Tomorrowland, 2019](http://tomorrowland.com) and [Airbeat One, 2019](airbeat-one.de).

## Research Interest

My research interests primarily lie in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, as well as their applications. I am fascinated by the human language and pretty much even remotely related to it, though I am slightly inclined towards researching on using language as a tool for human-computer interaction. I have also developed an interest in multimodal learning, researching at the intersection of natural language processing and computer vision.
