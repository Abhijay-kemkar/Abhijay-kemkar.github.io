## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="dp.jpg">

Hi! I am a junior year student of B.E. Computer Science at Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani.
I like to explore different fields and keep learning!! Currently i'm learning to make machines learn.

I also like to travel a lot and I've done many short treks in the Himalayas.

I seldom wake up early and like to think of myself as being a night-owl. Blame my alarm. 
The only time I wake up early is when I want to play Badminton or Tennis! I have also
taken part in Indian Classical Instrumental 
Orchestra as a Hawaiin Guitarist. 

I also like to take part in various social 
service activities. I'm currently a member of NSS-BITS Pilani chapter, where I 
teach Computers to people. I have also taught in a school run by Sri Aurobindo 
Education Society for disadvantaged childern. I have also served in the Sri 
Aurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry.

## Research Interest

My research interests are mainly in the field of Machine Learning with a focus on ANN. I love understanding how such models work and mimic humans in cognitive tasks. I love to take a multidisciplinary approach to every problem I face.

I have worked on Wearables and IOT and I believe in the theory to make **my** world
personalized to **me**! That's probably the reason I like softwares and platforms 
which I can customize a lot! I believe that IOT along with machines that mimic humans
will be a starting step to make my world tuned to my needs and wishes.

No, I'm not selfish. I just believe that everyone should live in a world personalized
to them. Wouldn't **that** be great!?

## Experience and Projects

### **DataCube for Uttarakhand | IIRS, ISRO**

*May 2016 - July 2016*

I have worked in Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, Indian Space Research 
Organization (**ISRO**) in the summer of 2016. I was working in the project 
titled "*Development of Datacube for Uttarakhand using GeoSpatial Technologies*".
Our task was to study the techniques of forming a DataCube and create one for ISRO.

I was involved in determining the best GIS image storage formats for storing the 
large satellite image data. I was also involved in the preprocessing of the raw 
satellite digital number data to useful products such as Radiance and Reflectance. 

I also modeled the core API and Execution Engines of the DataCube and created 
algorithm templates which could run on the data of the area selected by the 
user on an interactive web portal. 

The code for the DataCube is open source and you can find it on [Github](http://github.com/sharat910/datacube-iirs).

### **BITS LifeGuard | Mentor: Dr. Rahul Banerjee**

*October 2015 - present*

In LifeGuard we are developing a fault-tolerant, cost-effective smart driver 
safety jacket with real time monitoring of vital signs, to prevent road 
accidents and taking emergency action in the unlikely case an accident occurs.

I have worked on authentication schemes of wireless sensor nodes and a compute
node which are communication via bluetooth. The sensor nodes have pretty low 
computing capabilities. I was also involved in creating some automation 
scripts in python language for creating connections and transmitting data between
the sensors.

### **Wearables Sensor Fusion | Mentor: Dr. Rahul Banerjee**

*August 2016 - Present*

Currently I'm working on adaptive learning aspects of Body Sensor Networks 
and Sensor Data Fusion. My work consisted of literature survey of various sensor
data fusion techniques used in Body Sensor Networks for IOT devices.

I am also currently implementing and testing accuracy of various sensor fusion 
algorithms which are based on Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines,
Bayesian probabilistic theory as well as Hidden Markov Models and finally those 
based on Fuzzy Logic and Decision trees. The accuracy of these models will be 
measured on real-time driving data which will be taken using a simulator built by the team.

### **e-Yantra | Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay**

*March 18th and 19th 2016*

e-Yantra is an initiative to spread education in Embedded systems and Robotics
by IIT Bombay. It is sponsored by the Ministry of Human Resource Development, 
Government of India. It is a group competition where students in a team of 4 
program a given robotic platform to solve a given problem in 12-15 weeks.

The competition consisted of programming a FireBird-5 bot to solve a given problem
statement. I was a part of a team of four and after 3 months of coding the bot, 
we were selected for the finals of e-Yantra out of around 500 teams. 

We came **2nd** in out theme of "Hotel Room Service" out of 57 teams from all 
over India in the finals which were held on 18th and 19th March 2016, at the 
IIT Bombay Campus.
