## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="dp2.jpg">

Hey! I am Rishabh, and I'm a senior year undergraduate student of B.E. Computer Science at [Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani). I am broadly interested in theory and applications of Machine Learning.
More recently, I have been working on a few projects involving Sensor Fusion and basic Computer Vision techniques. I also regularly take part in sport programming (competitive programming)
competitions ([spoj](http://www.spoj.com/users/rishabh__joshi), [codeforces](http://www.codeforces.com/profile/rishabhjoshi)). I have also done projects in the field of Robotics and IoT. I like to explore different fields and keep learning!

I have also had the opportunity to work on some interesting problems at IIRS, ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization) and Samsung Research Institute, Bangalore.

I'm very passionate to make a significant impact in the field of Computer 
Science.

## Research Interest

My research interests are mainly in the field of Machine Learning and IoT with a focus on applications of ML techniques to various domains including pervasive computing systems.
Of late, I have also started taking interest in ANNs and Deep Neural Networks because of the intriguing way they 
work and mimic humans in cognitive tasks, especially those related to __Vision__ and __Language__.
