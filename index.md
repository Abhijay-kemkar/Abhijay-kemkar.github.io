## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="dp.jpg">

Hi! I am a junior year student of B.E. Computer Science at Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani.
I like to explore different fields and keep learning. Currently i'm learning to make machines learn.

## Research Interest

My research interests are mainly in the field of Machine Learning with a focus on ANN. I love understanding how such models work and mimic humans in cognitive tasks. I love to take a multidisciplinary approach to every problem i face.

## Something about me

I also like to travel a lot and I've done many short treks in the Himalayas.

I seldom wake up early and like to think myself of being a night-owl. Blame my alarm. 
The only time I wake up early is when I want to play Badminton or Tennis!

There was a time when I used to take part in Indian Classical Instrumental 
Orchestra as a Hawaiin Guitarist. I also like to take part in various social 
service activities. I'm currently a member of NSS-BITS Pilani chapter, where I 
teach Computers to people. I have also taught in a school run by Sri Aurobindo 
Education Society for disadvantaged childern. I have also served in the Sri 
Aurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry.

## Experience and Projects

I have worked in Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, Indian Space Research 
Organization (**ISRO**) in the summer of 2016. I was working in the project 
titled "*Development of Datacube for Uttarakhand using GeoSpatial Technologies*".
Our task was to study the techniques of forming a DataCube and create one for ISRO.

I was involved in determining the best GIS image storage formats for storing the 
large satellite image data. I was also involved in the preprocessing of the raw 
satellite digital number data to useful products such as Radiance and Reflectance. 

I also modeled the core API and Execution Engines of the DataCube and created 
algorithm templates which could run on the data of the area selected by the 
user on an interactive web portal. 

The code for the DataCube is open source and you can find it on [Github](http://github.com/sharat910/datacube-iirs).

Here is a table
