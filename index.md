## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="dp.jpg">

Hi! I am a third year undergraduate student of B.E. Computer Science at [Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani](www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani).
Currently I'm doing a few projects involving Machine Learning. I have also worked in fields like Cryptography and Application Development. I also regularly take part in sport programming (competitive programming)
competitions ([spoj](www.spoj.com/users/rishabh__joshi), [codechef](www.codechef.com/users/rishabh__joshi)). I have also done projects on Robotics and IOT. I like to explore different fields and keep learning. 

I'm very passionate to make a significant impact in the field of Computer 
Science.

Apart from academics, I actively take part in extra curricular activities 
and various social events. I have taken part in an Indian Classical 
Instrumental Orchestra as a Hawaiin Guitarist. I have been on various treks
in the Himalayas. I am an active member of 3 Clubs in my university and I
believe that these activities serve as building blocks of personality
development. I am also very active in social work and strongly believe 
that the greatest satisfaction lies in serving others.

Some of my other interests are playing sports like badminton, football & tennis and touch-typing! (clocked 82wpm at [keyhero](http://keyhero.com/profile/rishabhjoshi).

## Research Interest

My research interests are mainly in the field of Machine Learning with a focus on ANN. I love understanding how such models work and mimic humans in cognitive tasks. I love to take a multidisciplinary approach to every problem I face.

I have worked on Wearables and IOT and I believe in the theory to make **my** world
personalized to **me**! That's probably the reason I like softwares and platforms 
which I can customize a lot! I believe that IOT along with machines that mimic humans
will be a starting step to make my world tuned to my needs and wishes.
