## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="dp.jpg">

Hi! I am Abhijay. I am a pre-final year student at Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), Pilani, majoring in Mechanical Engineering. I am broadly interested in Robotics, particularly in Aeriel Robotics, UAVs, Motion Planning and Machine Learning.

I most recently worked as an Inderpendant researcher under [Hanna Hans](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hanna-hans-360a8718a/) at [Thynklogy](https://thynklogy.com). I focused on designing and developing an Autonomous UAV navigation and human detection algorithm. I also worked on existing Human Detection algorithms such as HOG and Haar Cascades, and UAV navigation algorithms such as FIESTA, Voxblox and Artificial Potential Fields. For the implementation, I made a simple CNN architecture to detect humans trained on the MIT Pedestrian Dataset.

I previously worked under [Prof. Chris Biemann](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/people/chris-biemann.html) at the [Language Technology Lab](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/home.html) in [Universität Hamburg](https://www.uni-hamburg.de/en.html), as a scholar of the [DAAD-WISE](https://www.daad.de/deutschland/stipendium/datenbank/en/21148-scholarship-database/?daad=1&detail=50015295&origin=4&page=1&q=wise&status=1&subjectGrps=) scholarship. I worked on query-autocompletion for unseen prefixes, mostly experimenting with using contextualized embeddings to better capture the sense. Details can be found in my résumé/CV or under the projects section. 

In my sophomore year, I was lucky to get selected for [Google Summer of Code, 2018](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2018/projects/6278298501906432/) as a part of the amazing [BioJS](biojs.net) community. I was mentored by [Rowland Mosbergen](https://twitter.com/rowlandm?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), [Yo Yehudi](http://yo-yehudi.com/) and [Dennis Schwartz](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/dennis-schwartz-093315b3). 

I also interned at [Indian Institute of Remote Sensing](https://www.iirs.gov.in/), a research centre of [Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO)](https://www.isro.gov.in/), where I worked on a flight planning software for a UAV.

I am a huge fan of travelling, mostly travelling cheap and light. I was able to travel 21 countries before I turned 21 years old (Nov 19)! I am also a huge fan of electronic music, having attended [Tomorrowland, 2019](http://tomorrowland.com) and [Airbeat One, 2019](http://www.airbeat-one.de)!!!

## Research Interest

My research interests primarily lie in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, as well as their applications. I am fascinated by the **human language** and pretty much everything related to it, though I am slightly inclined towards researching on language as a tool for **human-computer interaction** and that sparks my interest in **dialogue systems and question answering models**. I have also developed an interest in **multimodal learning**, researching at the intersection of natural language processing and computer vision.
