### **Speech Emotion Recognition in Dialogues | NTU, Singapore**

*August 2019 - Present*

I am working as a research intern at the **Speech and Language Processing Group** under [Prof. Chng Eng-Siong](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/aseschng/). I am working on creating dialogue centric models to detect emotion from speech and text. I am currently experimeting with convolutional RNNs and plan to use a GCN model as well. Evaluation is being done on the IEMOCAP dataset.

### **Query AutoCompletion for Unseen Prefixes | Universit√§t Hamburg, Hamburg**

*May 2019 - July 2019*

I worked at [Language Technology Lab](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/home.html) under [Prof. Chris Biemann](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/people/chris-biemann.html).

### **DataCube for Uttarakhand | IIRS, ISRO**

*May 2016 - July 2016*

I have worked in [Indian Institute of Remote Sensing](http://www.iirs.gov.in/), [Indian Space Research 
Organization (**ISRO**)](http://www.isro.gov.in/) in the summer of 2016. I was working in the project 
titled "*Development of Datacube for Uttarakhand using GeoSpatial Technologies*".
Our task was to study the techniques of forming a DataCube and create one for ISRO.

A DataCube is a model which can be used to quickly process temporal satellite data to observe _trends_ in various products like Vegetation Cover, Farm Land Use etc.

I was involved in determining the best GIS image storage formats for storing the 
large satellite image data. I was also involved in the preprocessing of the raw 
satellite digital number data to useful products such as Radiance and Reflectance. 

I also modeled the core API and Execution Engines of the DataCube and created 
algorithm templates which could run on the data of the area selected by the 
user on an interactive web portal. 

The code for the DataCube is open source and you can find it on [Github](http://github.com/sharat910/datacube-iirs).

### **BITS LifeGuard | Mentor: [Dr. Rahul Banerjee](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/rahulbanerjee/profile)**

*Nov 2015 - Jan 2018*

In [LifeGuard](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/ProjectBITSLifeGuard/Home) we have developed a fault-tolerant, cost-effective smart driver 
safety jacket with real-time monitoring of vital signs, to prevent road 
accidents and taking emergency action in the unlikely case an accident occurs.

I worked on adaptive learning aspects of Body Sensor Networks 
and **Sensor Data Fusion**. My work consisted of a literature survey of various sensor
data fusion techniques used in Body Sensor Networks for IoT devices using 
sensor data like GSR, ECG, HR, Respiration, etc.

I also implemented and tested the accuracy of various sensor fusion 
algorithms which are based on Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines,
Bayesian probabilistic theory, Hidden Markov Models and finally those 
based on Fuzzy Logic and Decision trees. The accuracy of these models will be 
measured on real-time driving data which will be taken using a simulator built by the team.

### **Distance Iris Recognition | Mentor: [Dr. Kamlesh Tiwari](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/kamleshtiwari/profile)**

*January 2017 - May 2017*

Iris Recognition is a well worked on the problem of recognizing people based on
biometric iris data. We worked on a solution for Iris Recognition on 
Distance images (low-quality Iris), using the CASIA Distance Dataset.

The model proposed performs well, with correct recognition rates of over
85%, with just preliminary filtering and enhancing 
of the low-quality Iris from the distance images. Gabor filters have been used for matching, after extracting the iris data after segmentation.

Future work will involve clearing the database of blurry images of varying
degrees and matching using both the eyes' iris, instead of the currently
used one-eye matching to further enhance the matching accuracy.

### **Ad Effectiveness and their Impact on Sales | Mentor: [Dr. Sangeeta Sharma](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/sang/profile)**

*January 2017 - May 2017*

I was working on correlating Sales with Advertisements to measure the effectiveness of Ads on Sales. 

I used NLP tools on Google Trends as well as consumer sales data correlate the Ads with Sales. 
The Sales data was obtained courtesy [Govt. of India](http://data.gov.in/). 
I also used YouTube comments on Ads to correlate sentiments with the particular Ad to show how more emotional ads have a stronger impact on sales.

### Mini Projects

* **PSO Optimized K-Means**: Studied and implemented Particle Swarm Optimization to improve clustering performance of K-Means Clustering Algorithm

* **Heading Generation using Speech Phonetics**: Created a crawler to obtain clean speech audio and generated a summary and its heading using phonetics and tone of the speaker

* **Parallel branch and bound**: Implemented a parallel skeleton for branch and bound to solve NP-Hard problems on a cluster of workstations. 

* **Compiler for ERPLAG**: Created a compiler in C for a dummy language as part of Compiler course. Implemented the parser and code generator.

* **Network Packet Sniffer**: Created a network packet sniffer to mimic the functions of Wireshark to sniff packets and display an analysis of packets being transmitted on the network.

* **One Class Classification**: Used Extreme Learning Machines to solve the problem of Outlier Detection using One Class Classification for Sensor Data.

### **APOGEE MapMyIndia Hackathon | BITS, Pilani**

*April 2017*

Was part of team *TrippyMinds*, which came **1st** in a Machine Learning hackathon 
organized by [MapMyIndia](www.mapmyindia.com/) on [Kaggle](https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/mapmyindia2), a famous platform for Machine Learning Contests, for APOGEE, the technical fest of BITS Pilani.

The problem consisted of solving the problem of detecting the speed limits 
of roads from street signs captured in images taken on the highways of India. Our approach consisted of an ensemble of custom trained 
HaarCascade Classifiers running under an ensemble of simple CNN to 
classify the extracted bounding boxes.

### **DECode Hackathon | HackerEarth**

*October 2017*

Participated and came **3rd** in a Machine Learning hackathon 
organized by D.E. Shaw on [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenge/competitive/de-shaw-de-code/), a famous platform for Machine Learning and Competitive Coding Contests. 

The problem was to predict the Chances of Investment for different users for the Month of July using the data for investments from those users for January to June. I used XgBoost after feature engineering.

### **e-Yantra | Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay**

*March 18th and 19th 2016*

[e-Yantra](http://portal.e-yantra.org/) is an initiative to spread education in Embedded systems and Robotics
by [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/). It is sponsored by the Ministry of Human Resource Development, 
Government of India. It is a group competition where students in a team of 4 
programs a given robotic platform to solve a given problem in 12-15 weeks.

The competition consisted of programming a FireBird-5 bot to solve a given problem
statement. I was a part of a team of four and after 3 months of coding the bot, 
we were selected for the finals of e-Yantra out of around 500 teams. 

We came **2nd** in our theme of "Hotel Room Service" out of 57 teams from all 
over India in the finals which were held on 18th and 19th March 2016, at the 
IIT Bombay Campus.
