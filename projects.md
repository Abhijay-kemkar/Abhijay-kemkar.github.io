### **DataCube for Uttarakhand | IIRS, ISRO**

*May 2016 - July 2016*

I have worked in [Indian Institute of Remote Sensing](http://www.iirs.gov.in/), [Indian Space Research 
Organization (**ISRO**)](http://www.isro.gov.in/) in the summer of 2016. I was working in the project 
titled "*Development of Datacube for Uttarakhand using GeoSpatial Technologies*".
Our task was to study the techniques of forming a DataCube and create one for ISRO.

I was involved in determining the best GIS image storage formats for storing the 
large satellite image data. I was also involved in the preprocessing of the raw 
satellite digital number data to useful products such as Radiance and Reflectance. 

I also modeled the core API and Execution Engines of the DataCube and created 
algorithm templates which could run on the data of the area selected by the 
user on an interactive web portal. 

The code for the DataCube is open source and you can find it on [Github](http://github.com/sharat910/datacube-iirs).

### **Distance Iris Recognition | Mentor : [Dr. Kamlesh Tiwari](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/kamleshtiwari/profile)**

*January 2017 - May 2017*

Iris Recogntion is a well worked on problem of recognizing people based on
biometric iris data. We worked on a solution for Iris Recognition on 
Distance images (low quality Iris), using the CASIA Distance Dataset.

The model proposed performs well, with correct recoginition rates of over
85%, with just priliminary filtering and enhancing 
of the low quality Iris from the distance images. Gabor filters have been used for matching, after extracting the iris data after segmentation.

Future work will involve clearing the database of blurry images of varying
degrees and matching using both the eyes' iris, instead of the currently
used one-eye matching.

### **BITS LifeGuard | Mentor: [Dr. Rahul Banerjee](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/rahulbanerjee/profile)**

*October 2015 - Present*

In [LifeGuard](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/ProjectBITSLifeGuard/Home) we are developing a fault-tolerant, cost-effective smart driver 
safety jacket with real time monitoring of vital signs, to prevent road 
accidents and taking emergency action in the unlikely case an accident occurs.

I have worked on authentication schemes of wireless sensor nodes and a compute
node which communicate via bluetooth. The sensor nodes have pretty low 
computing capabilities. I was also involved in creating automation 
scripts in python language for creating connections and transmitting data between
the sensors.

### **Wearables Sensor Fusion | Mentor: Dr. Rahul Banerjee**

*August 2016 - Present*

Currently I'm working on adaptive learning aspects of Body Sensor Networks 
and Sensor Data Fusion. My work consisted of literature survey of various sensor
data fusion techniques used in Body Sensor Networks for IOT devices.

I am also currently implementing and testing accuracy of various sensor fusion 
algorithms which are based on Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines,
Bayesian probabilistic theory, Hidden Markov Models and finally those 
based on Fuzzy Logic and Decision trees. The accuracy of these models will be 
measured on real-time driving data which will be taken using a simulator built by the team.

### **APOGEE MapMyIndia Hackathon | BITS, Pilani**

*April 2017*

Was part of team *TrippyMinds*, which came first in a campus Machine Learning hackathon 
organized by [MapMyIndia](www.mapmyindia.com/) on [Kaggle](https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/mapmyindia2), a famous platform for Machine Learning Contests, for APOGEE, the technical fest of BITS Pilani.

The problem consisted of solving the problem of detecting the speed limits 
of roads from street signs captured in images taken on the roads and 
highways of India. Our approach consisted of an ensembel of custom trained 
HaarCascade Classifiers running under an ensembel of simple CNNs to 
classify the extracted bounding boxes.

### **e-Yantra | Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay**

*March 18th and 19th 2016*

[e-Yantra](http://portal.e-yantra.org/) is an initiative to spread education in Embedded systems and Robotics
by [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/). It is sponsored by the Ministry of Human Resource Development, 
Government of India. It is a group competition where students in a team of 4 
program a given robotic platform to solve a given problem in 12-15 weeks.

The competition consisted of programming a FireBird-5 bot to solve a given problem
statement. I was a part of a team of four and after 3 months of coding the bot, 
we were selected for the finals of e-Yantra out of around 500 teams. 

We came **2nd** in out theme of "Hotel Room Service" out of 57 teams from all 
over India in the finals which were held on 18th and 19th March 2016, at the 
IIT Bombay Campus.
