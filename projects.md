### **Machine Learning for Structural Health Monitoring | CRIS Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute**

*August 2020 - Present*

I am working as a research intern at **CEERI, Pilani** under [Prof. Solomon Raju](https://www.ceeri.res.in/profiles/kota-solomon-raju/). I am working on analyze Machine Learning algorithms for smart sensors like acoustic, strain gauges, and image processing and their use in the advancement of [Structural Health Monitoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_health_monitoring). I also developed the model curvature and matrix curvature analysis of these mothords using Machine Learning.. I further Implemented 2nd order ODE to find an alternative to NDT via the use of python in the Linear Regression Model.

### **Autonomous UAV Based Human Detection System for Search and Rescue  | Thynklogy, Silicon Valley, California**

*May 2020 - Present*

I worked remotely under [Hanna Hans](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hanna-hans-360a8718a/). I Designed and Developed an Independent project which aims to develop a path planning algorithm that maximises the rate of detecting humans in an urban search operation. I experimented with the recently developed path planning algorithms such as APF, voxblox as well as a ESDF maps, to autonomously find a route, avoiding all obstracles in a 3D environment. I also used Computer Vision and Image Processing techniques and a Convolutional Neural Network trained to scan and identify the structure of humans via a primary camera installed on the drone.

### **Machine Learning for Defect Analysis | Plastic Water Labs, Bangalore**

*May 2018 - July 2018*

I worked at [Plastic Water Labs](http://www.iirs.gov.in/) in the summer of 2020. I was working in the project titled "*Defect Detection based on images from basic cameras*". The project involved the creation of an application that would automatically detect defects in a product by capturing images and running them through the **Machine Learning Algorithm**, along with classifying them on the basis of size and colour.

The main problem was that the size was not a feature to be dicided as it required a refernce frame, and hence, I had to devise a way by which a white square of known dimentions was scanned and then the sixe of the object of interest could be identified after. I extracted height and width data from running the model on the white square and using it as a reference, I checked the size of other objects. The idea worked. This project gave me the inspiration to face problems with novel, off-the-track ideas.

### **Finding Shortest Path for a 2 DOF Robot using Dijkstra and A* Algorithm | [Computational Motion Planning](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_RmvLnQSR1D0xzanoOlTDYPMfPfIB8wt/view?usp=sharing)**

*March 2020 - May 2020*

Developed a path planning algorithm for a dummy Robot in matlab. In a 2-Dimensional 11Ã—11 grid Configuration space consisting of obstacles, the path planned by **Dijkstra** and **A star algorithm** from a start and end node was compared.

### **Classification and Prediction of Land Buyers using Machine Learning Algorithms | [Machine Learning](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19Zatt3T9Ap0QaPr_MSK9SZSwYSnaKUo-/view?usp=sharing)**

*February 2020 - March 2020*

The Classifier Machine Learning model uses Algorithms like **SVM**, and **Decision Trees** to predict whether a client would buy land based on the Dataset of age and Annual income of the buyer and thus classifying them into two categories, buyer and not the buyer. This is a case of **supervised learning** where the algorithm is first trained on a set of clients pursued in the past years.

### **Sudoku Solver | [Computer Vision and Backtracking](https://github.com/Abhijay-kemkar/Sudoku)**

*July 2020 - August 2020*

Created a sudoku solving application which scans for sudoku puzzle from the primary camera video, identifies the digits using **Image Processing** and **Computer Vision** and extracts them via a **CNN model** trained on **MNIST database**. Solves the sudoku via the **backtracking algorithm** and overlays the solution on the puzzle being scanned by the camera.

### **Quadrotor Trajectories Planning and Control | Mentor: [Dr. Lavika Goyal](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/lavikagoel/profile)**

*October 2018 - November 2018*

Design an implementation of a controller for a **3D quadrotor**. Tested the controller with two trajectories, the first one was a line trajectory and the second one was a more complex helical shaped trajectory. Also, Implemented a trajectory generator which outputs **time parameterised trajectories** which allows a quad-rotor to fly through pre-decided waypoints.

### **Distance Iris Recognition | Mentor: [Dr. Kamlesh Tiwari](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/kamleshtiwari/profile)**

*January 2017 - May 2017*

Iris Recognition is a well worked on the problem of recognizing people based on
biometric iris data. We worked on a solution for Iris Recognition on 
Distance images (low-quality Iris), using the CASIA Distance Dataset.

The model proposed performs well, with correct recognition rates of over
85%, with just preliminary filtering and enhancing 
of the low-quality Iris from the distance images. Gabor filters have been used for matching, after extracting the iris data after segmentation.

Future work will involve clearing the database of blurry images of varying
degrees and matching using both the eyes' iris, instead of the currently
used one-eye matching to further enhance the matching accuracy.

### **Ad Effectiveness and their Impact on Sales | Mentor: [Dr. Sangeeta Sharma](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/sang/profile)**

*January 2017 - May 2017*

I was working on correlating Sales with Advertisements to measure the effectiveness of Ads on Sales. 

I used NLP tools on Google Trends as well as consumer sales data correlate the Ads with Sales. 
The Sales data was obtained courtesy [Govt. of India](http://data.gov.in/). 
I also used YouTube comments on Ads to correlate sentiments with the particular Ad to show how more emotional ads have a stronger impact on sales.

* **Heading Generation using Speech Phonetics**: Created a crawler to obtain clean speech audio and generated a summary and its heading using phonetics and tone of the speaker

* **Parallel branch and bound**: Implemented a parallel skeleton for branch and bound to solve NP-Hard problems on a cluster of workstations. 

* **Compiler for ERPLAG**: Created a compiler in C for a dummy language as part of Compiler course. Implemented the parser and code generator.

* **Network Packet Sniffer**: Created a network packet sniffer to mimic the functions of Wireshark to sniff packets and display an analysis of packets being transmitted on the network.

* **One Class Classification**: Used Extreme Learning Machines to solve the problem of Outlier Detection using One Class Classification for Sensor Data.
